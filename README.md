This is an project developed by [Gianluca Tranchedone](https://twitter.com/gtranchedone) for an coding interview test.

## Set up

The project has no external dependencies. You can just open the project and run it.

*__If you cloned this project from a Git repository like GitHub, pay attention to the notes below!__*

### Environment

Before you can compile the project, you have to create an `Environment.json` file in the root folder of the project that follows the example set in the provided `Environment.example.json`. In fact, you're better-off copying the example json file and replacing the values in there with the correct values for your environment.

NOTE: `Environment.example.json` is used to run UnitTests, so don't delete it!
